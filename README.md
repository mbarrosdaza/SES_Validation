# Overview

This repository contains the data and scripts used for validating the Subway Environmental Simulation (SES) model against experimental data. The objective is to assess the accuracy of the SES model in predicting airflow, temperature distributions, and flow rates under fire and cold flow conditions. This repository provides all the necessary input and output files for the SES simulations conducted in SES validation.
