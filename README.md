# Overview

This repository contains the data and scripts used for validating the Subway Environmental Simulation (SES) model against experimental data. The objective is to assess the accuracy of the SES model in predicting airflow, temperature distributions, and flow rates under fire and cold flow conditions. This repository provides all the necessary input and output files for the SES simulations conducted in SES validation. 

# Contents
Measured Data: Includes experimental data from the Memorial Tunnel tests such as Heat Release Rate (HRR), temperature, and flow rate.

SES Results: Contains the output from SES simulations, which include temperature and flow rate predictions.

SES Inputs: Contains SES input files.

# Purpose of the Repository
The primary aim of this repository is to validate the SES model by comparing its predictions with experimental measurements
